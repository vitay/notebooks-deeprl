    "\n",
    "* for $t \\in [0, T_\\text{total}]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Select an action $a_t$ based on $Q_\\theta(s_t, a)$, observe $s_{t+1}$ and $r_{t+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Store $(s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ in the experience replay memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Every $T_\\text{train}$ steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Sample a minibatch $\\mathcal{D}_s$ randomly from $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The main difference with Q-learning is that `update()` will be called only every `T_train = 4` steps: the number of updates to the trained network will be 4 times smaller that the number of steps made in the environment. Beware that if the ERM does not have enough transitions yet (less than the batch size), you should not call `update()`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 4 - `update()`: training the value network\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the provided minibatch, one should implement the following part of the DQN algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each transition $(s_k, a_k, r_k, s'_k)$ in the minibatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Compute the target value $t_k = r_k + \\gamma \\, \\max_{a'} Q_{\\theta'}(s'_k, a')$ using the target network.\n",

    "\n",
    "So we just need to define the targets for each transition in the minibatch, and call `model.fit()` on the trained network to minimize the mse between the current predictions $Q_\\theta(s_k, a_k)$ and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we have a problem: the network has two outputs for the actions left and right, but we have only one target for the action that was executed. We cannot compute the mse between a vector with 2 elements and a single value... They must have the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we want only the train the output neuron corresponding to the action $a_k$, we are going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the trained network to predict the Q-value of both actions $[Q_\\theta(s_k, 0), Q_\\theta(s_k, 1)]$.\n",
    "2. Replace one of the values with the target, for example $[Q_\\theta(s_k, 0), t_k]$ if the second action was chosen.\n",
    "3. Minimize the mse between $[Q_\\theta(s_k, 0), Q_\\theta(s_k, 1)]$ and $[Q_\\theta(s_k, 0), t_k]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, the first output neuron has a squared error of 0, so it won't learn anything. Only the second output neuron will have a non-zero mse and learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more efficient ways to do this (using masks), but this will do the trick, the drawback being that we have to make a forward pass on the minibatch before calling `fit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest is pretty much the same as for your Q-learning agent. Do not forget that actions leading to a terminal state should only use the reward as a target, not the complete Bellman target $r + \\gamma \\max Q$.\n",

    "\n",
