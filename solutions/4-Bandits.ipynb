    "The main drawback of greedy action selection is that it does not explore: as soon as it finds an action better than the others (with a sufficiently positive true Q-value, i.e. where the sampled rewards are mostly positive), it will keep selecting that action and avoid exploring the other options. \n",
    "\n",
